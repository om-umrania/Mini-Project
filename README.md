## Installation Guide

To run the code in this repository, you will need to install Visual Studio Code, Python 3, and specific Python libraries. Here's a step-by-step guide to get everything set up.

### Prerequisites

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop. [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Python 3:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation guide specific to your operating system.

### Installing Libraries

After setting up Python 3, you will need to install a few of Python libraries to run the code. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

#### Installing Pycryptodome

```sh
pip install pycryptodome
```

*Reference:* [No module named : ‘Crypto’](https://medium.com/@rajparmar23801/no-module-named-crypto-707f75186a6a)

#### Install pyDes

```sh
pip install pyDes
```

*Reference:* [pyDes Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pyDes/)



## Part A: Cyber Security

### Prerequisite Courses, if any
